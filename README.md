# areal-comparison

Code for the manuscript Howes *et al.* "Comparing models for spatial structure in small-area estimation" (in preparation).

## File structure

The directories of this repository are:

| Directory   | Contains |
|-------------|--------------|
| `make`      | Scripts used to run the reports. `_make.R` runs everything in order. |
| `misc`      | Miscellaneous code, not used as part of `orderly`. |
| `src`       | All `orderly` reports. |
| `utils`     | Helper scripts for common development tasks. |

## `orderly`

We use the [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) package ([RESIDE, 2020](https://reside-ic.github.io/)) to simplify the process of doing reproducible research.
After installing [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) (from either CRAN or Github) a report, let's say called `example`, may be run by:

```r
orderly::orderly_run(name = "src/example")
```

The results of this run will appear in the `draft/` folder (ignored on Github).
To commit the draft (with associated `id`) to the `archive/` folder (also ignored on Github, and which should be treated as "read only") use:

```r
orderly::orderly_commit(id)
```

Any outputs of this report will then be available to use as dependencies within other reports.
